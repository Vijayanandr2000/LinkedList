# LinkedList Implementation in Java

## Description

This project provides a basic implementation of a singly linked list in Java. It includes various operations such as adding nodes, inserting nodes at a specific position, deleting nodes, reversing the list, and retrieving the size or k-th element.

## Features

- **Add**: Add a new node to the end of the list.
- **Insert**: Insert a node at a specific position.
- **Delete**: Delete a node at a specific position.
- **Reverse**: Reverse the entire linked list.
- **Size**: Get the size of the linked list.
- **K-th Element**: Retrieve the k-th element from the linked list.

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LinkedList-Implementation.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd LinkedList-Implementation
   ```

### Usage

1. Compile the `LinkedList` class:
   ```bash
   javac LinkedList.java
   ```

2. Run the `Main` class:
   ```bash
   java Main
   ```

3. Interact with the linked list operations as demonstrated in the `Main` class.

## Operations Demonstrated

- Adding nodes
- Inserting nodes at specific positions
- Deleting nodes at specific positions
- Reversing the linked list
- Retrieving the size of the linked list
- Accessing k-th element from the list
